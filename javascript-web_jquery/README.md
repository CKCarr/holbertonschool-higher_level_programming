## General

    Why jQuery makes front-end programming easy: jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies and streamlines front-end web development. It provides a collection of functions and methods that allow developers to perform common tasks, such as selecting elements, manipulating the DOM, handling events, making AJAX requests, and more, with concise and easy-to-read code. jQuery abstracts away many of the complexities of working with JavaScript, making it more accessible and efficient for front-end development.

    How to select HTML elements in JavaScript: In JavaScript, you can select HTML elements using various methods, such as document.getElementById(), document.querySelector(), and document.querySelectorAll(). These methods allow you to select elements based on their IDs, class names, or tag names.

    How to select HTML elements with jQuery: In jQuery, element selection is made even easier with its concise syntax. You can select elements using functions like $(), $.find(), and $.filter(). jQuery provides powerful selectors that resemble CSS selectors, allowing you to target elements using IDs, class names, tag names, attribute values, and more.

    Differences between ID, class, and tag name selectors: In both JavaScript and jQuery, you can select elements using different types of selectors. ID selectors (#id) target a specific element with a unique ID attribute. Class selectors (.class) target multiple elements with the same class name. Tag name selectors (tagName) target all elements of a particular tag name.

    How to modify an HTML element's style: You can modify an HTML element's style using the style property in JavaScript or the css() method in jQuery. Both allow you to change CSS properties of elements dynamically.

    How to get and update an HTML element's content: In JavaScript, you can get and update an element's content using the innerHTML property. In jQuery, you can use methods like text(), html(), and val() to get and set element content.

    How to modify the DOM: The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of an HTML document. You can manipulate the DOM in JavaScript and jQuery to add, remove, or modify elements dynamically.

    How to make a GET request with jQuery Ajax: jQuery provides the $.ajax() method to make HTTP requests, including GET requests. You can use it to fetch data from a server and handle the response asynchronously.

    How to make a POST request with jQuery Ajax: Similarly, you can use the $.ajax() method to make POST requests, which are used to send data to a server for processing.

    How to listen/bind to DOM events: In both JavaScript and jQuery, you can attach event listeners to DOM elements to listen for specific events, such as clicks, keypresses, form submissions, etc.

    How to listen/bind to user events: User events refer to interactions with the web page initiated by the user, like clicks, keyboard input, mouse movements, etc. You can use event listeners to respond to these user actions and trigger specific actions or functions in response.
