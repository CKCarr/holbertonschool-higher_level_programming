  "description": "Why jQuery makes front-end programming easy: jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies and streamlines front-end web development. It provides a collection of functions and methods that allow developers to perform common tasks, such as selecting elements, manipulating the DOM, handling events, making AJAX requests, and more, with concise and easy-to-read code. jQuery abstracts away many of the complexities of working with JavaScript, making it more accessible and efficient for front-end development.",
